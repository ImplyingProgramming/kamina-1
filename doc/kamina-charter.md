##Project Kamina

Kamina is an alternative Internet platform to the Web, with an emphasis on communities over committees.  The goal is to provide open and equal access to services designed and distributed in a tightly-knit ecosystem, defined by standardized encoding formats and protocols.
---
###Preliminary Use Case

    * Facebook, and similar services using the Web as a platform, are more and more discouraging natural group formation and discussion.
    * Alternative services exist on the Web, but the platform is also evolving to discourage these alternatives from competing on their own merits. 
    * Changes to the platform are more political than technologically focused, making new service development, deployment, maintenance, and marketing cumbersome at best.

---
###Project Objectives

    * Creation of a platform steered by core technologies that will not require more than minimal changes over multiple generations.
    * Requiring the existence of a functioning reference implementation for the approval of any proposed standard.
    * Allowing for standards and reference implementations to co-exist with one another, and be developed easily and efficiently, with this core technology as a foundation.
    * Transparent, and open collaboration on well-defined system components.

---
###Major Deliverables

    * Design, architecture, and engineering documentation.
    * Reference implementations of all system standards
    * Preliminary marketing material for promoting the new platform to outside groups

---
###Roles & Responsibilities

    * Project Manager - Maintaining core planning documentation, schedule estimation, and facilitating internal communication.
    * System Designer - Identifying requirements core to different systems comprising the project, providing for common vocabulary and high-level descriptions of components, and maintaining structural diagrams for use-case scenarios, logic flowcharts, etc.
    * System Architect - Deriving existing technologies that fulfill core project requirements, identify when new technologies must be developed entirely, and defining exact engineering tasks for the project team.
    * System Engineer - Fulfilling individual engineering tasks, determining best algorithms to implement different protocols and encodings, and maintaining automation for testing and deployment suites.
    * End-Application Producer - developing systems and services utilizing the project platform, providing useful feedback to project staff, and help further the reach of the platform.
    * End-Application Consumer - utilizes systems and services either from End-Application Producers, or directly utilizing resources provided by the project, providing useful feedback to staff, and help further the reach of the platform.

###Assumptions

    * A project with traceable progress, active participants, and clear objectives will be adopted by the group.
    * Existing solutions solve parts of the problem as presented, but could do more in combination.
    * Existing solutions lack an enthusiastic community base to promote themselves, and maintain their technologies to sustain relevance.
    * It is reasonable to expect a modern platform to include frameworks and languages facilitating development sprints of 12 working hours, versus an entire 40 hour work-week.
